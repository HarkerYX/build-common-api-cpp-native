A bash script encoding of all the steps in:

"CommonAPI C++ **D-Bus** and **SOME/IP** and in 10 minutes (from scratch)"

The script is now building both D-Bus and SOME/IP versions in one go.  The
original individual instruction pages are linked above.  After running the
compilation script you can choose to run either one of the simple
client/server ping-pong test.

I still recommend you go through the manual steps to learn how to do this
in general - that's the idea of the tutorial of course.  The purpose of
storing the FIDL example files in the repository and scripting the compilation
is mostly to prepare a simple automated test.
