A bash script encoding of all the steps in:

"CommonAPI C++
[D-Bus](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5472316)
and
[SomeIP](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5472320)
in 10 minutes (from scratch)"

The script is now building both D-Bus and SomeIP versions in one go.  The
original individual instruction pages are linked above.  After running the
compilation script you can choose to run either one of the simple
client/server ping-pong test.

I still recommend you go through the manual steps to learn how to do this
in general - that's the idea of the tutorial of course.  The purpose of
storing the example files already created, and scripting it is mostly to
prepare a simple automated test.
